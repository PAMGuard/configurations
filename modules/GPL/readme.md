# GPL Detector Configurations
The configuration files can be used with the PAMGuard Generalized 
Power Law Detector which is an implementation of the algorithm described in 
Tyler A. Helble, Glenn R. Ierley, Gerald L. Dâ€™Spain, and Marie A. Roch and 
John A. Hildebrand. The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 131, 2682 (2012).

To use these files, first create a PAMGuard configuration with a GPL detector, 
then import the GPL configuration from the GPL dialog. See the online help for further details.
